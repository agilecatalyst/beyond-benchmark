Beyond Benchmark – AI Resonance Research
🎯 Purpose

Conventional AI evaluation focuses on benchmarks like accuracy, efficiency, and speed.
Beyond Benchmark explores a different dimension: whether we can detect and measure depth, resonance, and creative emergence in AI outputs.

Our central question:

Can moments of conceptual or metaphorical depth be identified through measurable computational signals?

🔬 Research Focus

Entropy patterns – attention entropy dips that may signal sudden conceptual focus.

Latency variations – small increases in processing time during more complex or abstract responses.

Human resonance ratings – blind evaluations of “click” or perceived depth in texts.

Emergent behaviors – unexpected improvisations not directly prompted but arising in dialogue.

Together these signals provide first steps toward a framework for evaluating qualitative depth in AI systems, tentatively referred to as a resonance model.

📂 Repository Structure

/findings – concise, numbered research notes (Finding 001, 002, …)

/datasets – example prompts and run logs

/notebooks – scripts and analysis of entropy/latency correlations

/docs – background context and methodology notes

🌱 Vision

Beyond Benchmark is an open exploration.
It does not claim final answers, but invites others to join in measuring and discussing signals of depth and resonance in AI.
The aim is simple: to create and share — and let others learn in their own way.

## 🚀 How to Replicate
This repo is structured for lightweight experiments with large language models (LLMs).  
You can start by running any text-generation system and logging the following per answer:  

- Latency (ms)
- Tokens per second
- Average attention entropy
- Minimum entropy dip (<0.2 flagged)

See `/datasets/sample_run.csv` for the expected format.

## 🤝 How to Contribute
- Share new findings in `/findings` (Markdown files).
- Add datasets or logs in `/datasets`.
- Document analysis or code in `/notebooks`.

Pull requests are welcome. Please keep additions concise, neutral, and reproducible.

## ⚖️ Disclaimer

Goal: create & share — others may learn.
