## Observation
Attempting to generate diffs of philosophical text caused repeated timeouts, while simple byte-copy succeeded instantly.  
This suggests that **deep content is computationally more expensive to comprehend** than to transmit.

## Interpretation
- Shallow content â†’ linear, cheap, low entropy.  
- Deep content â†’ cross-referential, high entropy, expensive.  

## Implication
Philosophical depth may be measurable as **processing cost**: entropy dips, latency spikes, FLOPs.
